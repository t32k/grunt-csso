# grunt-csso

This is a custom grunt.js multitask aka [gruntplugin](http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/qzRjD/show/) that minification task with [CSSO](http://css.github.com/csso/) for you.

## Dependencies

You need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt), installed for this to work.

## Installation & Options

1. Install this grunt plugin next to your project's grunt.js gruntfile with: `npm install grunt-csso`.
2. Call `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-csso')` in your gruntfile.
3. Configure `grunt csso` to minimizes your CSS file and call the task(s).
  e.g.:

  ```javascript
    csso: {
      dist: {
        src: 'assets/css/core.css',
        dest:'assets/css/core.min.css'
      }
    }
  ```

4. You can turns __structure minimization__ off like this:

    ```javascript
    // Default value is true.
    restructure: false
    ```

5. You can add banner comment like in [grunt-contrib-concat](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat) or [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify):

    ```javascript
    banner: '/* Copyleft */'
    ```

# An Example Setup

```javascript
csso: {
  options: {
    restructure: false,
    banner: '/* Copyleft */'
  },
  dev: {
    files: {
      "path/to/output.css": ["path/to/input_one.css", "path/to/input_two.css"]
    }
  },
  prod: {
    options: {
      restructure: true
    },
    files: [
      {src: 'path/to/input_one.css', dest: 'path/to/output_one.css'},
      {src: 'path/to/input_two.css', dest: 'path/to/output_two.css'}
    ]
  }
}

```
